/**
    <p>
    A ShortnameService maps shortnames to full URIs so that classes and
    properties in web APIs can refer to them compactly and legally. A
    shortname should always be both a legal NCName and a legal Javascript
    variable name.
    </p>

    <p>
    The shortname to URI mapping is unique but the URI to shortname
    is not, there is a preferred shortname for each URI but can also
    have non-preferred shortnames (e.g. with prefixes).
    </p>

    <p>
    The shortnames are defined via annotations (api:label, rdfs:label)
    in either the API specification or a referenced vocabulary file.
    Where such labels are not available we fall back on local names,
    or prefixed-local names.
    </p>

    <p>
    Derived from the original ShortnameService (which is now an implementation
    class, StandardShortnameService).
