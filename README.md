<h1>Elda, an implementation of the Linked Data API</h1>

<p>
	Elda is a Java implementation of the 
	<a href="http://code.google.com/p/linked-data-api/" rel="nofollow">Linked Data API</a>,
	which provides a configurable way to access RDF data using simple 
	RESTful URLs that are translated into queries to a SPARQL endpoint. 
	The API developer (probably you) writes an API spec (in RDF) which 
	specifies how to translate URLs into queries. 
</p>

<p>
	Elda is the 
	<a href="http://www.epimorphics.com/web/">Epimorphics</a> implementation of the LDA. The <i>standalone jar</i>
	comes with pre-built examples which allow you to experiment with the style 
	of query and get started with building your own configurations using
	<i>elda common</i> or your own webapps.
