# Rendering Elda results with Velocity templates

Elda uses a *renderer* to generate output from the set of RDF
resources that are selected by the input URL. Starting with
version 1.3.0, Elda uses by default a renderer based on [Apache
Velocity](http://velocity.apache.org) to generate HTML output. This
renderer is a complete re-write of the older, provisional Velocity
renderer, and is not backwards compatible with the previous version.

In the remainder of this guide, we will show you:

* [how to set-up and configure the Velocity renderer in the configuration code](#config-use-velocity);
* how to customise the stylesheets to change the look and feel of the rendered output;
* how to customise the Velocity macros to change specific renderering behaviours;
* what's available in the API provide to Velocity template developers.

## What does a renderer do?

Elda uses the information from the URL, together with the configuration
file, to generate SPARQL queries to the underlying triple store and
select a set of RDF resource and their descriptions (i.e. sets of RDF
properties). This resultset is returned to the requester in some format:
JSON, XML, Turtle or an HTML web page. A *renderer* is the part of Elda
that turns the resultset into the output format. The HTML renderer does
that job to display HTML web pages. In previous versions of Elda, the
default HTMl renderer used XSLT to convert the resultset to HTML. That
renderer is still included in Elda, but since version 1.3.0 we have
switch to using Velocity as the default HTML renderer.

Here is an example of a site that uses Velocity to render HTML pages:

![]({{ "/images/velocity-screenshot-1.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

# <a name="config-use-velocity"></a>Configuring and using the Velocity renderer

To use the Velocity renderer to generate HTML, attach this formatter to
your API spec:

{% highlight html linenos %}
<yourSpec> api:defaultFormatter
  [a elda:VelocityFormatter ;
   api:name "html" ;
   api:mimeType "text/html" ;
   elda:className "com.epimorphics.lda.renderers.VelocityRendererFactory" 
  ]
{% endhighlight %}

This will do two things: it will create an instance of a
`VelocityRendering` each time a resultset needs to be rendered into
HTML, and it will look for a template file (and associated assets) to
turn the `VelocityRendering` into HTML output. The root template file
is `index.vm`. Other than the name, the renderer makes no assumptions
about the root template, or what it does with the information in the
`VelocityRendering`.  A standard template is provided in the *Elda assets*
project &ndash; you are free to use this standard template as-is, adapt
it to your needs, or ignore it and create your own Velocity templates
to meet your needs precisely.  Guidance for customising the standard
template appear below.

### What's the difference between the VelocityRendering and the template?

Rendering a resultset into HTML using Elda's Velocity renderer goes
through two stages. In the first, a `VelocityRendering` object is
created. This stage has two goals:

* to create a set of Java accessor objects, which provide a convenience API onto the elements of the resultset so that the template developer's job is easier. For example, an Elda resultset frequently split up into manageable units that the LDA calls *pages* (the first 10 results, the second 10, etc). Page information is recorded into the RDF statements in the LDA resultset. To make this easier to use in a template, we provide a Java object `com.epimorphics.lda.renderers.common.Page`. The `Page` object has direct API calls, such as `pageNumber()`, `itemsPerPage()` to make it easy to incorporate the information from the page description in RDF into a template
* to unwind the graph into a tree-structure, suitable for display in an HTML document model or other tree-structured output notation.

Both of these jobs *could* have been achieved in the Velocity template
language, VTL. However, VTL has some limitations in terms of performance
and expressiveness, that make this harder. Moreover, by writing the
`VelocityRendering` objects in Java, it becomes much easier to write
unit tests to ensure correct, stable behaviour over time.

### Configuration options

The Velocity renderer uses three `api:variable`s in the configuration to specify non-default values for configuration options:

* `velocityTemplate` for the name of the root template file (default: `index.vm`)
* `_resourceRoot` for a path that should be prepended to assets, such as CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files
* `_velocityPath` for a path on the server's file system where the Velocity templates are found.

#### Example

Suppose you unpack the files from *Elda assets* into `/var/www/elda/assets`, and that you arrange that all requests coming in to *myEldaApp* are forwarded from the front-end Apache or Nginx server to a Tomcat webapp container hosting Elda. We need to supply both of these pieces of information to the Elda config, so that the dynamically generated pages will contain the correct links:

{% highlight html linenos %}
<myEldaAppSpec> api:defaultFormatter
  [a elda:VelocityFormatter ;
   api:name "html" ;
   api:mimeType "text/html" ;
   elda:className "com.epimorphics.lda.renderers.VelocityRendererFactory" ;
   api:variable [
     api:name "_resourceRoot"; 
     api:value "/myEldaApp"
   ];
   api:variable [
     api:name "_velocityPath"; 
     api:value "/var/www/elda/assets"
   ]
  ]
{% endhighlight %}

Now suppose that we would like to override some of the default behaviours of the Velocity renderer. Velocity's behaviour is to use the first definition of a macro or partial that it finds, so our overrides have to be found before the default files. We decide to put our locally customised assets into `/var/www/myEldaApp/assets`:

{% highlight html linenos %}
<myEldaAppSpec> api:defaultFormatter
  [a elda:VelocityFormatter ;
   api:name "html" ;
   api:mimeType "text/html" ;
   elda:className "com.epimorphics.lda.renderers.VelocityRendererFactory" ;
   api:variable [
     api:name "_resourceRoot"; 
     api:value "/myEldaApp"
   ];
   api:variable [
     api:name "_velocityPath"; 
     api:value "/var/www/myEldaApp/assets, /var/www/elda/assets"
   ]
  ]
{% endhighlight %}

**Other notes **

* You can choose to specify a Velocity formatter as a property of an
endpoint rather than as the API-wide default.
* You can change the associated suffix of the formatter by changing the
value of its `api:name` property, and change the content-type of the
generated page by changing the value of the `api:mimeType` property.

### The full velocity path

The configured _velocityPath isn't the whole story about where Elda's
velocity renderings search for macro files. The full path that Elda
uses is in order:

* the configured _velocityPath
* the directory `/etc/elda/conf.d/APP/_error_pages/velocity/`
* the directory `_error_pages/velocity/` in the webapp
* the final fallback directory `velocity/` in the webapp

The second and third entries exist for handling error pages.

### Velocity properties

Velocity uses a set of [configuration
properties](http://velocity.apache.org/engine/releases/velocity-1.5/developer-guide.html#velocity_configuration_keys_and_values)
to control aspects of its internal behaviour. By default,
we leave all of these properties with their default values,
execpt that `file.resource.loader.path` is set to the path
given by `_velocityPath`. However, the renderer will look for a
`velocity.properties` file in the loader path, so you can override
any of the default Velocity configuration properties by creating a
`velocity.properties` file with appropriate keys and values. For example:

{% highlight properties linenos %}
input.encoding = UTF-8
output.encoding = UTF-8
{% endhighlight %}

# <a name="customising-velocity-renderer"></a>Customising the Velocity HTML renderer

The built-in renderer's stylesheets and Velocity templates are intended to be a complete out-of-the-box solution for generating usable HTML pages from Elda results. However, in many cases it's desirable to customise the output. Common examples include: changing the colour scheme to fit the look and feel of an existing site,  and extending special behaviours to display certain kinds of RDF data in content-specific ways. We cover both of these cases below.

## <a name="customising-look-and-feel"></a>Customising the CSS stylesheets

All of the styling information for the HTML pages generated by the Velocity templates is handled by CSS stylesheets. Following best practice for CSS, there are no [inline styles](http://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS_basics#Inline_styles) used in the generated pages.

In the *Elda assets* project, all of the relevant files can be found in the `src/main/webapp` directory (this follows the Apache Maven standard layout for web application projects). Within this directory, all of the files relevant to the Velocity renderer are in the `velocity/` directory, and the stylesheets are in `velocity/css`. In here, you will find styles related to various elements of the standard layout generated by Elda's Velocity renderer:

* `bootstrap.min.css`, `bootstrap-theme.min.css` <br /> By default, Elda's HTML pages use the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) responsive design framework. Other Bootstrap themes can be downloaded from the internet.
* `font-awesome.min.css` <br /> Provides a collection of [useful icon glyphs](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
* `codemirror.css`, `fold-gutter.css`, `jquery.datatables.min.css`, `qonsole.css` <br /> Used to support the SPARQL editing console used to view and run example SPARQL queries provided by Elda
* `site.css` <br /> Elda-specific styles

In general, `site.css` is first place to start when seeking to change the look and feel of Elda generated pages, although selecting a different Bootstrap theme might also be a good initial step for more radical changes.

### Example: changing the basic colour scheme

Elda's default stylesheet uses a dark blue as a base colour. Let's suppose that we want to change that to use an amber theme. Here are sample before and after screenshots of the change we want to make:

<figure>
  <img src="{{ "/images/velocity-screenshot-3.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"
       alt="Before and after changing resource colours"></img>
<figcaption>Figure 1: Before and after changing resource colours in `site.css`</figcaption>
</figure>

Here is the CSS needed to change the colours of the outer and nested RDF resource labels, and the top navigation bar:

{% highlight css linenos %}
/* Colours for outermost resource labels */
h1.resource-label {
  background-color: #ffc107;
  color: #111;
}
section {
  border-color: #ffe082;
}

/* Colours for nested resource labels */
h3.resource-label {
  background-color: rgb( 255, 193, 7 );
  background-color: rgba(255, 193, 7, 0.8);
  color: #111;
}
.nested {
  border-color: #ffe082;
}

/* Navigation bar colours */
.navbar-default {
  background: linear-gradient(#ff6f00, #ffb300 80%, rgba(256, 256, 256, 0.3)) repeat scroll 0 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);
}

.navbar h1 {
  font-size: 18pt;
  margin-top: 0;
  padding-top: 10px;
}

.navbar h1 a {
  color: white;
  vertical-align: top;
  font-weight: bold;
}
{% endhighlight %}


These CSS rules can simply be added to the `site.css` stylesheet that is deployed on your system. However, a disadvantage of this approach is that unpacking a new release of *Elda assets* onto your system risks overwriting your changes. Conversely, never updating *Elda assets* means that you risk not benefitting from the latest updates. A more robust method of incorporating the changed stylesheet can be achieved with a small change to the Velocity templates, as shown below.

## <a name="customising-velocity-templates"></a>Customising the Velocity templates

The default Velocity templates in *Elda-assets* are designed to be modular, so that it is easier for maintainers of Elda-based systems to customise the behaviour and appearance of the generated pages. In particular, some hooks are built-in in convenient places. For example, the template defining the header of the page reads:

{% highlight velocity linenos %}
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge,chrome=1">
  <title>$page.pageTitle()</title>
  <meta name="description" content="HTML rendering of Linked Data API results: $page.pageTitle()">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

  #parse( "partials/scripts.vm" )
  #parse( "partials/css.vm" )

  <script src="$assets/js/vendor/require.js"></script>
  <script>
    #parse( "partials/javascript-dependencies.vm" )
  </script>
  <!-- This link provides CORS support in IE8+ -->
  <!--[if lt IE 10]>
    <script src="${assets}/js/vendor/jquery.xdomainrequest.js"></script>
  <![endif]-->

  #parse( "partials/head-extensions.vm" )
</head>
{% endhighlight %}

The key element here is on line 20, where `partials/head-extensions.vm` is added to the `head` element. The default contents of `head-extensions.vm` are:

{% highlight velocity linenos %}
## Extension point to add additional content to <head> element
## E.g. additional JavaScript or CSS resources, or analytics
{% endhighlight %}

In other words, it adds no content. However, Velocity operates a 'first found, wins' rule - if the template engine finds a different version of `partials/head-extensions.vm` on its load path *before* the default, it will use that instead. We can use that to load an additional stylesheet, which will override the built-in default CSS rules:

{% highlight velocity linenos %}
## Alternate version of head-extensions.vm
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/local-assets/css/site-local.css">
{% endhighlight %}

All we have to do now is arrange for this alternative version of `head-extensions.vm` to be found first. There are various strategies for achieving this: which one suits you will depend on your circumstances. Common choices include:

* defining a Maven assembly goal to pull-together resources from different locations to create a custom assets `.war` file
* using a deployment system, such as chef, puppet or capistrano to script the process of putting files where they are needed on a given server, perhaps using a web server such as Apache HTTPD or Nginx to handle static file serving.

For the purposes of this documentation, we will describe a simpler strategy using only Tomcat (or another web application container). Note: this pattern works well for development and prototyping, it may not be suitable for full-scale deployments.

### Simple deployment example using Tomcat

*Note: these instructions have been tested on a Linux system. They may need to be adjusted for other operating systems.*

The default directory for deploying `.war` files is typically something like `/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps`. Elda provides two `.war` files that will allow us to set up a minimal deployment: `elda-common.war` and `elda-assets.war` &ndash; copying these files to the `webapps` directory should create two unpacked web applications: `elda-common` and `elda-assets`. By default, Elda common will look for configuration files in `/etc/elda/conf.d/elda-common`.

We also need a location from which Tomcat will serve our local, customised stylesheets and any other assets we need.  In the `webapps` directory, alongside `elda-common` and `elda-assets`, we create a directory structure with the following layout:

    local-assets
    +-- css
    |   +-- site-local.css
    +-- velocity
        +-- partials
            +-- head-extensions.vm

There's actually not really a need to keep the Velocity extensions within the Tomcat web application, as they're not actually going to be served out to browsers. But it's handy to keep the files together for illustrative purposes in this documentation.

Now that we have a new version of `head-extensions.vm` that we can have Elda find, it just remains to tell Elda where to look. In the configuration file, we set the `_velocityPath`

{% highlight html linenos %}
<myEldaAppSpec> api:defaultFormatter
  [a elda:VelocityFormatter ;
   api:name "html" ;
   api:mimeType "text/html" ;
   elda:className "com.epimorphics.lda.renderers.VelocityRendererFactory" ;
   api:variable [
     api:name "_resourceRoot"; 
     api:value "/myEldaApp"
   ];
   api:variable [
     api:name "_velocityPath"; 
     api:value "/var/lib/tomcat7/local-assets/velocity, /var/lib/tomcat7/elda-assets/velocity"
   ]
  ]
{% endhighlight %}

With that, Elda will find the alternate `head-extensions.vm` first, thereby generating a link element that will ask Tomcat for `/local-assets/css/site-local.css`.

## <a name="velocity-elements-guide"></a>Guide to Velocity template elements

In this section, we outline some of the more commonly overridden elements in the default Velocity templates. This is only a guide: the most definitive reference is to read the Velocity source code in `src/main/webapp/velocity` in the Elda assets sub-project.

| Element  | Filename  | Description |
| ------------ | ---------------| -----|
|       | `index.vm` | Overall page template |
|     | `partials/overrides.vm`        |  Loaded first, so a good place to add macros or partials that override default definitions |
|  | `partials/scripts.vm`        | A place to load JavaScript files that are not loaded via requireJS |
| | `partials/css.vm`| Loads default CSS stylesheets. Also loads `partials/styles-extra.vm`, which would be an alternative extension point to the head extensions partial. |
| | `partials/javascript-dependencies.vm` | JavaScript files, loaded using requireJS. |
| | `partials/head-extensions.vm` | Generic extension point for adding content to the `head` element |
| | `partials/title-brand.vm` | Loads the branding (image and title) into the navigation bar |
| | `partials/item-endpoint.vm` | Defines the body content for an endpoint that presents a single item |
| | `partials/list-endpoint.vm` | Defines the body content for an endpoint that presents a list of items |
| `eldaItem` | `macros/item.vm` | Entry point for rendering a single RDF resource as an item in the output |
| `itemName` | `macros/item.vm` | Renders the human-readable name of the resource, picking a suitable label from `rdfs:label`, `skos:prefLabel`, etc |
| `itemProperties` | `macros/item.vm` | Renders a list of the properties of an item |
| `literalValuedNode` | `macros/item.vm` | Presents a property value which is a literal value |
| `resourceValuedNode` | `macros/item.vm` | Presents a property value which is a nested RDF resource |
| `groupVisualExtensions` | `macros/item-extensions.vm` | Control point for injecting extended views of a collection of resources, such as a map or chart |
| `itemVisualExtension` | `macros/item-extensions.vm` | Control point for injecting an extended visual presentation of a single item, such as showing a point on an embedded map. |

### Example: adding a custom attribute to every item label

Suppose we want every RDF resource to have a unique ID attached via a data attribute. The macro that renders item names is `itemName`, so we create a copy of `partials/overrides.vm` somewhere earlier in the `_velocityPath` (see above). Into this alternate version of `overrides.vm`, add:

{% highlight velocity linenos %}
## Display the name of the resource
#macro( itemName $resource $h $css $node )
  <div class="$css">
    <$h class="resource-label"
        data-id="$node.uniqueID()"
    >
      $resource.getName()
      #if( $node )
        #actionsMenu( $node )
      #end
    </$h>
  </div>
#end
{% endhighlight %}

Most of this version of `itemName` is directly copied from the default, with just the addition of line 5.
