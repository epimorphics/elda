ELDA

Modules for Jena-based implementation of the linked data api and 
associated JSON encoding.

This is organized as a multi-module Maven project with
the follow modules:

  o elda-lda            - core code for Elda
  o elda-standalone     - deliverable webapp with standalone jar
  o elda-common         - externally configurable elda
  o elda-assets         - images, stylesheets, etc for elda
  o elda-system-tests   - test client
  o elda-testing-webapp - server for system tests

Eclipse project and settings should not be in the repository.
If not using m2clipse then create the Eclipse settings using:

   mvn -DdownloadJavadocs=true -DdownloadSources=true eclipse:eclipse

[The download options are optional beware that the jersey sources and 
 javadocs are usually excruciatingly slow to download.]

Import into Eclipse using the multi-project import tool from:
http://eclipse-tools.sourceforge.net/updates/

Elda documentation lives in docs/E*html. The latest version is
referenced by docs/quickstart.html. Older documentation persists
but not indefinitely.

BUILDING ELDA

Elda is built using maven in the usual way: `mvn package` to
build in the local module filestore, `mvn install` to build
and install in your local repository, `mvn deploy` to build
and push the artifacts into the Epimorphics public repository
(assuming you have the appropriate password in your maven
settings.xml).

RELEASING ELDA

* PREREQUISITES

  Running Linux with git installed.

  Have a local Elda project up-to-date with respect to
  the github repository (and maybe with your own
  local updates).

  Have permission to update the deployment repository.

  Have permission to administer the project githib pages.  

  Willing to commit to this latest Elda version.

* PREAMBLE

  Run a test build using `mvn install`. 
  If it fails, you'll have to fix it.
  Run any other tests to hand, eg building an Elda
  application and eyeballing the results of well-known
  queries [this will become automated at some point].

  IN PARTICULAR, after consultation with other interested
  parties (eg Stuart), build a new EA webapp, put it up
  on staging, and check that the BW app works. It makes
  many specific queries and the app working says that
  very many of these (still) work.

  Note: release notes, docs are in the gh-pages branch.

  Ensure the release notes are up-to-date. The top
  entry in ReleaseNotes/latest.text should be marked 
  DEVELOPING. Use `git log | more` to check changes since
  the previous release and incorporate them into the
  release notes, summarising where appropriate and 
  putting important/big changes early. Change DEVELOPING 
  to RELEASED.

  run

	bin/release-docs -r x.y.z x.y.z+1-SNAPSHOT

  where the current release is x.y.z, to make the
  next snapshot documetation directory and roll the
  updated documentation into current.

  Commit (with a suitable "releasing" -m) and push.
  under change control (if there are, maven release
  will object loundly and clunkily). If there are,
  deal with them appropriately.

//* MAVEN RELEASE
//
//  Remove any existing /tmp/tempSCM directory.
//  Clone the elda project into /tmp/tempSCM.
//
//    git clone --bare https://github.com/epimorphics/elda.git tempSCM
//
//  In your USUAL elda development directory
//
//    mvn --batch-mode release:prepare
//    mvn --batch-mode release:perform
//
//  This builds and deploys non-SNAPSHOT Elda artifacts.
//  It should not fail (that's what the "run test build"
//  and "all files under change control" steps are for).
//
//  THIS STEP IS NOT IDEMPOTENT AND NOT REVERSIBLE. The
//  release/prepare-perform cycle converts $VERSION-SNAPSHOT
//  to $VERSION and deploys the Elda artifacts, tagging
//  the repository, before incrementing the version and
//  creating $VERSION'-SNAPSHOT. Because convention decrees
//  that existing artifacts aren't deleted or changed,
//  the new Elda version is Out There and can't be pulled
//  back. 
//
//  This is far from perfect but will have to do. 

RELEASING WITHOUT MAVEN RELEASE

We've been having some problems with maven release and
it's hard to explore them without multiple deploys
cluttering up the repository. So instead I've been
doing the release "by hand".

(a) Ensure that there are no uncheckedin files and
    that we are currently on a SNAPSHOT version eg
    v.f.p-SNAPSHOT.

(b) mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=v.f.p

(c) remove *versionsBackup and */*versionsBackup

(d) git commit -a -m "Comment expressing we are at v.f.p"

(e) git tag elda-v.f.p

(f) git push origin elda-v.f.p

(g) mvn clean deploy
    At this point there is a deployed .p for maven dependencies
    and updated source code tagged with .p.

(h) mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=v.f.p+1

(i) remove *versionsBackup and */*versionsBackup

(j) git commit -a -m "Comment expressing we are at v.f.p+1 SNAPSHOT"

(g) mvn clean deploy
    And now the source is tagged as SNAPSHOT for further
    development. 


* POSTAMBLE 

  Note the name $STANDALONE of the standalone jar

	http://repository.epimorphics.com/com/epimorphics/lda/elda-standalone/$VERSION/elda-standalone-$VERSION-$DETAILS

  where VERSION is the version you have just released and DETAILS is
  the maven-defined timestamp of the release. Edit the project index.html
  to refer to $STANDALONE.

  Add a new release marker to the release notes with
  the next release version tagged DEVELOPING.

  Add a file to _posts with file name $DATE-$VERSION.md and content
  similar to previous such files, containing a short announcement of
  the release. Such a post must have a header line

    categories: release

  so that the post header is included in the templated
  index.md file. So see what this will looks like when
  pushed back to github, run

    bundle exec jekyll serve

  and browse the appropriate URL (which jekyll will report).
  [You may have to do gem updates for this to work ...]

  Email linked-data-api-discuss with a moderately chatty
  message about the update, summarising the release notes
  and specifically anything that has been recently mentioned,
  and including $STANDALONE.

  Email dev@jena.apache.org, users@jena.apache.org, and 
  semantic-web@w3.org a message with the following structure
  (and updated version number):

    Dear All
    
    We are pleased to announce the release of Elda ${version} [1]. 
    Elda is an implementation of the Linked Data API [2], which 
    allows SPARQL to be generated from configurable RESTful requests 
    and the resulting RDF data to be presented in a variety of 
    formats. Elda is implemented using Apache Jena [3]. Discussion 
    about Elda takes place on the Linked Data API discussion list [4].

  If there is something particularly important/urgent about this
  release, add it to the email body.
