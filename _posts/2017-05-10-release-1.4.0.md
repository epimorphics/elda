Elda 1.4.0 was released on 10th May 2017, with a new
query parameter \_query-id whose value is displayed
in log messages generated for this query.

Empty CONSTRUCT{} WHERE clauses are no longer generated.

Query parameters that appear in the request URI and which
are typed as resources will generate an BAD REQUEST if
the parameter value is not a legal SPARQL IRI_REF,
rather than an INTERNAL ERROR when the overall query is
parsed.
