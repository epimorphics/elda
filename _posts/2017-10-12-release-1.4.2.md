Elda 1.4.2 was released on 12th October 2017.

The embedded QConsole has been updated to be compatable
with Elda Common (#188).

Some errors in the Velocity renderer have been fixed
(eg #197, #153).

Missing resource for a standared URL has been restored
(#200).

Incorrect values for \_pageSize now report a 400 Bad Request
not a 500 Internal Error.

Logging configuration has been improved (see reference notes).
