* greater control over generated metadata is available, including
    suppressing it entirely.

* LDA variables can be set by an explicit query to the data source
    for the specified endpoint.

* config files may contain #include lines, allowing configurations
    to be built from shared components. Changing a file that has been
    #included will cause all configs that included it to be reloaded.

* inverse properties can now appear in view specifications

* filters using prefixes min-, max- etc can now be removed from
    the query through the UI.

* /api-config is now working again.
