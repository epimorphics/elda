Elda 1.3.19 was released on November 4th 2016.

Fixed synchronisation problem with reload-config-on-change.

Triple reordering for generated query takes better account
of text search properties, which are now always ordered
to the top of the query.

api:where components are now placed in a well-defined way.

Item template redirection now respects any formatter
present in the URL. (Previously redirections with
explicit formatters generated links which always 404d).
