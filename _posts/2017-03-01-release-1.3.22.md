Elda 1.3.22 was release on 1st March 2017.

Default value for exceptioIfEmpty is "no" for list
endpoints and "yes" for item endpoints (rather
than being the same for each).

When configs are repeatedly loaded, Elda no longer
stores all of that history and possibly running out 
of room.

If there are syntactic or semantic errors in an 
initially-loaded config file, it is possible to
recover by updating the config file -- previously
such an error could only be recovered by restarting
the container with corrected files.
