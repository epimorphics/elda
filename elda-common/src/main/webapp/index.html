<h1>Elda Common Webapp</h1>

<p>
Elda is a Java webapp implementation of the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/linked-data-api/">Linked Data API</a>.
This page is the root page of Elda's Common Webapp (CW) minimal web
application. You've probably got here by dropping the <code>elda-common.war</code>
file into your local running Tomcat's webapps directory.
</p>

<p>
The CW is a single WAR file that fetches its LDA configurations from
a "well-known" location in the file system. Keeping the LDA configuration
files outside the CW means that you can update them without having to
build a new WAR file &mdash; you just need to restart the webapp.
Similarly, you can update the CW with a new (compatible) version
without having to disturb the configuration files or build a new
webapp.
</p>

<p>
When a CW installed with context path {APP} requires configuration files, 
it looks in <code>/etc/elda/configs/{APP}_*ttl</code>. * is a wildcard
match of any number of non-/ characters; a single CW can load multiple
LDA configurations, and different CWs look for different configuration
files.
</p>

<h1>Elda Standalone Jar</h1>

<p>
You can also read the quickstart documentation for the
<code>elda-standalone</code> jar:
<a href="http://elda.googlecode.com/hg/deliver-elda/src/main/webapp/lda-assets/docs/quickstart.html">
quickstart</a>, an alternative way of getting started with Elda.
