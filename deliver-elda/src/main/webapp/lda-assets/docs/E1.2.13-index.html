<h1>Elda 1.2.13</h1>
<h2>An implementation of the Linked Data API</h2>
</div>

<p>
This document is a quick-start for the 
<a href="http://www.epimorphics.com">Epimorphics Ltd</a>
implementation, Elda, of the 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/linked-data-api/wiki/Specification">Linked Data API</a>.
The Elda runnable-demo jar can be downloaded from its Googlecode 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/elda/downloads/list">downloads page</a>;
pick the latest unless you have good reason not to.  
</p>

<p>
    A <a href="E1.2.13-advanced.html">separate document</a> describes
    Elda's extensions and an introduction to using Elda's
    code directly rather than bundled as servlets/restlets.
</p>

<p>
If you want to explore the Elda codebase and have
<a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a>
installed, you can download the Elda repository:

<pre>
hg clone https://elda.googlecode.com/hg/ elda  
</pre>

<p>
In the rest of this document, "the Elda jar" means the 
downloaded standalone demonstration jar.
</p>

<h3>What is the LDA?</h3>

<p>
The Linked Data API provides a configurable way to access RDF data
using simple RESTful URLs that are translated into queries to
a SPARQL endpoint. The API developer (probably you) writes an
API spec (in RDF) which specifies how to translate URLs into
queries. Elda comes with some pre-built examples which allow
you to experiment with the style of query and get started with
building your own specs.
</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>Elda is written in Java 
(using the <a href="http://openjena.org/">Jena RDF toolkit</a>),
so you will need Java installed on your system.
</p>

<p>
The default demonstration setup for Elda uses the 
<code>data.gov.uk</code>
data accessible from the SPARQL endpoint 
<code>http://services.data.gov.uk/education/sparql</code>.
To run the demonstration, you will need to have open
web access.
</p>

<h3>Feedback</h3>

<p>
  Elda aims to provide a complete implementation of the Linked Data API.
  Problems with Elda should be reported to the 
  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/linked-data-api-discuss">
  linked data API discussion group
  </a> (note: you will need a google account to use this group).
</p>

<p>
  Current issues can be seen on the
  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/elda/issues/list">
  Elda issues list
  </a>.
</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>
The Elda code is shipped as a single self-unpacking jar, 
<code>elda-VERSION.jar</code>. You can start it from the command line:

<pre>
java -jar elda-VERSION.jar
</pre>

or, if your system permits, by double-clicking on it in
your preferred file browser.
</p>

<p>
In either case, Elda unzips itself from that jar into a
new directory, Elda_VERSION, from which it starts
itself as a Jetty server running on port 8080.
You may immediately go to that URL in your browser:
it provides links to Elda's documentation and the
education example URIs.
</p>

<p>
You should now be able to browse to LDA URIs:
</p>

<pre>
<a href="http://localhost:8080/elda/api/education/schools.json">http://localhost:8080/elda/api/education/schools.json</a>

<a href="http://localhost:8080/elda/api/education/schools.xml">http://localhost:8080/elda/api/education/schools.xml</a>

<a href="http://localhost:8080/elda/api/education/schools.html">http://localhost:8080/elda/api/education/schools.html</a>

<a href="http://localhost:8080/elda/api/education/schools.xml?label=Hope+Primary+School">http://localhost:8080/elda/api/education/schools.xml?label=Hope+Primary+School</a>

<a href="http://localhost:8080/elda/api/education/schools.xml?max-schoolCapacity=100">http://localhost:8080/elda/api/education/schools.xml?max-schoolCapacity=100</a>
</pre>

and see presentations of selected schools' data. The html rendering
(which is provided by an XSLT transform of the xml rendering)
has many interesting features.
</p>

<p>
Once Elda has unzipped itself, you can run it from the Elda
directory it creates:

<pre>
(in Elda_VERSION)

java -jar start.jar
</pre>

(Or by double-clicking, etc).
</p>

<h2>If you can't use port 8080</h2>

<p>
You may already be using port 8080 for some local service.
In that case, you can start Elda from the command
line (no double-click) with

<pre>
java -jar elda.jar -Djetty.port=NNNN
</pre>

or, if you're starting from the unzipped Elda directory,

<pre>
java -Djetty.port=NNNN -jar start.jar
</pre>

where NNNN is the port of your choice. (Yes, the -D
comes after elda.jar, but before start.jar.)
</p>

<p>
To change the port number without having to
supply a <code>-Djetty.port</code> command line option
every time, in the Elda directory edit the
configuration file <code>etc/jetty.xml</code>
and change the line:

<pre>
&lt;Set name="port"&gt;&lt;SystemProperty name="jetty.port" <b>default="8080"</b>/&gt;&lt;/Set&gt;
</pre>

to:

<pre>
&lt;Set name="port"&gt;&lt;SystemProperty name="jetty.port" <b>default="NNNN"</b>/&gt;&lt;/Set&gt;
</pre>
where NNNN is the port number of your choice.
</p>

<h2>Using other LDA specifications</h2>

<h3>From the command line</h3>

<p>
To use different LDA specifications, use the system property 
<code>elda.spec</code>. Like the port number, it can be set
as part of launching the elda jar or when launching the jetty
start jar:

<pre>
java -jar elda.jar -Delda.spec=SPECS
</pre>

or (in the Elda directory):

<pre>
java -Delda.spec=SPECS -jar start.jar
</pre>

where SPECS is one or more LDA specification files separated
by commas.
</p>

<p>
If you use <code>elda.spec</code>, then Elda ignores the 
default specification (the education LDA) wired into it.
</p>

<h3>html formatters</h3>

<p>
The default formatter supplied by Elda is a very simple
HTML formatter showing the properties and their values of
the selected items. Elda also ships with a renderer that
uses XSLT (and Javascript at the client end) to produce
pages with additional controls and a richer appearance.
To use this as your html renderer, add:
<pre>	
; api:formatter 
  [a api:XsltFormatter
  ; api:name 'html'
  ; api:stylesheet 'xsltsheets/result-osm.xsl'
  ; api:mimeType 'text/html'
] 

</pre>

to your API root in your configuration file and arrange that
the webapps/elda directory contents are served as static files.
</p>

<h3>By editing web.xml</h3>

<p>
To change the specification used without having to use
a <code>-Delda.spec</code> command line option every time, edit the
Elda <code>webapps/elda/WEB-INF/web.xml</code>. Find the
servlet configuration

<pre>
&lt;servlet&gt;
  &lt;servlet-name&gt;loader-init&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
  &lt;servlet-class&gt;com.epimorphics.lda.routing.Loader&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
  &lt;init-param&gt;
    &lt;param-name&gt;com.epimorphics.api.initialSpecFile&lt;/param-name&gt;
    &lt;param-value&gt;<b>specs/education.ttl</b>&lt;/param-value&gt;
  &lt;/init-param&gt;
  &lt;load-on-startup&gt;1&lt;/load-on-startup&gt;
&lt;/servlet&gt;
</pre>

Replace <b>specs/education.ttl</b> with the name of the LDA
specification files you wish to load, separated by commas.
</p>

<h2>Querying a local file</h2>

<p>
If the remote SPARQL endpoint is slow, not yet fully configured,
or plain unimplemented, you might want to set up a local endpoint
using a tool like 
<a href="http://openjena.org/wiki/Fuseki">Fuseki</a>. But it's also
possible for Elda to query a local RDF file. 
</p>

<p>
Edit your spec file, which will look something like the
education spec suplied with Elda:

<pre>
spec:api
  a api:API ;
  rdfs:label "Edubase API"@en;
  api:maxPageSize 50;
  api:defaultPageSize 10 ;
  <b>api:sparqlEndpoint &lt;http://services.data.gov.uk/education/sparql&gt;</b> ;
  api:endpoint 
   spec:schools
   , spec:schoolsPrimary
   , spec:schoolsSecondary
   , spec:schoolsPrimaryDistrict
   , spec:schoolsSecondaryDistrict 
 .
</pre>

Replace the services URI with <b>local:content-name</b>, 
where <b>content-name</b> is the name of the RDF source you 
wish to query. When Elda issues queries to a local: endpoint, 
it loads (and remembers) the contents and queries those directly.
</p>

<p>
Usually the content-name is a file name. It is resolved against
the webapps context path (ie the directory from which it serves
files). If there is no such file, then the content-name is treated
as a URL and its contents fetched. If that fails, then the content
is searched for along the webapps classpath. In all of these cases,
the fetched content is loaded into memory as an RDF model and all
queries to the endpoint are answered by this model.
</p>

<p>
(The name-lookup functionality is supplied by the underlying Jena
<code>FileManager</code> class; for more details, see the Jena
documentation currently at openjena.org.)
</p>

<h2>Using a local TDB datasource</h2>

<p>
As an alternative to setting up a local SPARQL endpoint, 
or using a local: file, you can instead use a local
<a href="http://openjena.org/wiki/TDB">Jena TDB</a>
database. To do so you will need to modify the <code>web.xml</code>
webapp configuration file and supply an additional init-param
for the <code>loader-init</code> servlet. You can do this in
two ways:
<p>

<pre>
&lt;init-param>
  &lt;param-name>com.epimorphics.api.TDB-base-directory&lt;/param-name>
  &lt;param-value><b>tdb-directory</b>&lt;/param-value>
&lt;/init-param&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Replace <b>tdb-directory</b> with the path to
your chosen TDB directory. Note that the path is relative to the
webapps directory &ndash; your best choice is to use an absolute path.
</p>

<p>
<i>Warning</i>. If the directory does not contain any TDB files,
TDB will create a new empty dataset in it. This is usually not
what you want, since all queries will return no answers, so
Elda will report an error during setup.
</p>

<p>
The alternative form:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;init-param>
  &lt;param-name>com.epimorphics.api.dataStoreDirectory&lt;/param-name>
  &lt;param-value><b>datastore-directory</b>&lt;/param-value>
&lt;/init-param&gt;
</pre>

<p>
specifies <b>datastore-directory</b> as a directory containing a
TDB directory named <i>tdb</i>. The same warnings as above apply. 
(This form exists because Elda can do limited LARQ indexing and
in that case the datastore directory will have a <b>larq</b>
subdirectory for the LARQ indexes.)
</p>

<p>
Having specified a TDB directory, you can now edit your spec's
sparqlEndpoint declaration, which in the education example looks
like:

<pre>
spec:api
  a api:API ;
  rdfs:label "Edubase API"@en;
  api:maxPageSize 50;
  api:defaultPageSize 10 ;
  <b>api:sparqlEndpoint &lt;http://services.data.gov.uk/education/sparql&gt;</b> ;
  api:endpoint 
   spec:schools
   , spec:schoolsPrimary
   , spec:schoolsSecondary
   , spec:schoolsPrimaryDistrict
   , spec:schoolsSecondaryDistrict
 .
</pre>

Replace the services URI with <b>tdb:model-name</b>, where <b>model-name</b>
is the name of your endpoint model inside the TDB store.
